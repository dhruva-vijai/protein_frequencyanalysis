# protein_frequencyanalysis
This project is a hard-coded hierarchical clustering algorithm completely written in Python. The point of this project is to conduct a frequency analysis of the amino acid sequence of a given protein trained on a proteome downloaded from UniProt based on a hierarchical clustering-based machine learning algorithm.

The frequency distribution of an amino acid sequence has implications that characterise the biological function, evolutionary history, and 3D structure of the acid.

Hierarchical clustering is a relatively simple algorithm to execute and does not require much training data, but runs into problems regarding precision; thus the next goal in this project is to develop a neural-network based approach to classifications of the amino acid frequency vectors.

All credits for the clustering algorithm goes to www.pythonprogramming.net who provided a wonderful course and the source code for the algorithm. Protein sequences are obtained from the UniProt Database.
