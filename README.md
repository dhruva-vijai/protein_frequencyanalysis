# protein_frequencyanalysis
This project is a hard-coded hierarchical clustering algorithm completely written in Python. The point of this project is to conduct a frequency analysis of the amino acid sequence of a given protein trained on a proteome downloaded from UniProt based on a hierarchical clustering-based machine learning algorithm.
